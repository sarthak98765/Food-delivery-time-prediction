# üç¥ Food Delivery Time Prediction

A machine learning project to predict food delivery time based on three key features:  
1. **Age of the delivery partner**  
2. **Ratings of the delivery partner**  
3. **Distance between the restaurant and the delivery location**

## üìñ About
This project analyzes and predicts the time taken for food delivery using various parameters. The predictive model leverages both exploratory data analysis and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for accurate delivery time estimation.

---

## ‚ú® Features
1. **Age of Delivery Partner**: Young delivery partners tend to take less time for deliveries.
2. **Ratings of Delivery Partner**: Higher ratings correlate with faster delivery times.
3. **Distance**: Delivery time increases linearly with distance.
4. **Visualization**: Visual relationships between features and time using `Plotly` and `Seaborn`.

---

## üíª Technologies Used
- **Python**  
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `keras`, `tensorflow`, `matplotlib`
- **Machine Learning**  
  - LSTM Neural Network using `Keras` and `TensorFlow`.

## üîé Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Relationship Between Distance and Time Taken
![Scatter Plot - Distance vs Time Taken](#)  
- **Insights**: Delivery time consistently increases with distance, but most deliveries occur within 25-30 minutes.

### Relationship Between Time Taken and Age
![Scatter Plot - Age vs Time Taken](#)  
- **Insights**: Younger delivery partners take less time for deliveries.

### Relationship Between Time Taken and Ratings
![Scatter Plot - Ratings vs Time Taken](#)  
- **Insights**: Delivery partners with higher ratings deliver faster.

### Vehicle and Order Type Analysis
![Box Plot - Vehicle and Order Type](#)  
- **Insights**: No significant difference in delivery time based on vehicle type or order type.

## üîö Conclusion
The features contributing the most to food delivery time are:
1. **Age of the delivery partner**
2. **Ratings of the delivery partner**
3. **Distance between the restaurant and the delivery location**

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively applied to solve real-world problems in the food delivery industry.
